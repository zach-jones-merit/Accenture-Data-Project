# Accenture-data-Project
Some of the work preformed while completing Accenture's data analysis and visualizations data project. 
The focus was on demographical data to find effective marketing demographics.


This data orginated as eight seperate and unclean datasets.
The data was cleaned and merged using simple conditional formating and VLOOKUP in excel.


The data was converted into a downloadable .csv file and reopened in Tableau.
Performed seperate visuals across several sheets.
Collected the conclusive visuals to present in the dashboard.
